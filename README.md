# CDG STATTRAKR

This project is to track our work and get that extra motivation. For now lets track some simple actions in GitHub. I will store these actions in Supabase and award points to the user that performed the action. We need a leaderboard on the home page followed by a log of all the actions associated with it.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) - Database and authentication

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features to Implement

- Supabase integration for data storage
- Authentication for users
- Leaderboard on home page
- Action log with associated points
- GitHub action tracking

## Development Roadmap

1. Initial setup and configuration
2. Database schema design
